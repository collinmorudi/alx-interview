# Minimum Operations Project

## Overview
This project involves calculating the minimum number of operations required to achieve a given number of characters in a text file using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. The solution leverages various algorithmic and mathematical concepts such as dynamic programming, prime factorization, code optimization, and greedy algorithms.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and apply dynamic programming to break down complex problems into simpler subproblems.
- Utilize prime factorization to reduce the problem to finding the sum of prime factors of the target number.
- Optimize code for efficiency.
- Apply greedy algorithms to choose the best option at each step.
- Proficiency in basic Python programming, including loops, conditionals, and functions.

## Concepts and Resources
- **Dynamic Programming**: [Dynamic Programming (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/)
- **Prime Factorization**: [Prime Factorization (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modern-crypt/v/prime-factorization)
- **Code Optimization**: [How to optimize Python code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36491341/how-can-we-optimize-python-loops)

- **Basic Python Programming**: [Python Functions (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)

## Requirements
### General
- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Interpreter**: Python 3.4.3 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **File format**: All files must end with a new line and start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **Documentation**: Code must be documented
- **Coding style**: PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- **Executable files**: All files must be executable

## Tasks
### 0. Minimum Operations
- **File**: `0-minoperations.py`
- **Description**: This method calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` 'H' characters in the file using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.
- **Prototype**: `def minOperations(n)`
  - Returns an integer representing the minimum number of operations.
  - If `n` is impossible to achieve, returns 0.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  n = 9

  H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH

  Number of operations: 6
  ```
- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  # 0-main.py
  #!/usr/bin/python3
  """
  Main file for testing
  """

  minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations

  n = 4
  print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

  n = 12
  print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
  ```
